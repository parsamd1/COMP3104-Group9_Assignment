Learning DevOps engineering is crucial in the software development cycle for several reasons:
1. Improved Collaboration: DevOps emphasizes collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders. This ensures that all aspects of software development, from code creation to deployment and monitoring, are seamlessly integrated.
2. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): DevOps practices help in setting up automated pipelines for CI/CD. This means that code changes are automatically tested and deployed, reducing manual errors and speeding up the release process.
